his program sets up a basic network packet sniffer using the Scapy library, capturing and analyzing network packets in real-time. It extracts and logs key information such as source and destination IP addresses, the protocol (TCP/UDP), and the payload data, if available. The program efficiently decodes payloads, handling errors related to decoding issues. It runs continuously on a specified or default network interface, processing each captured packet as soon as it's received.

The sniffer terminates when the user manually interrupts it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), gracefully stopping the packet capture process. This approach ensures real-time analysis and efficient handling of packets while maintaining control over its termination.
